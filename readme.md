# Project Goals
Testing a slightly-more-accessible page-turning software for magazines based on these two scripts:
- [javascript code that parses PDF and translates it to a JS canvas](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js#online-demo)
- [this html page-turn software that takes a DOM (the JS file from before) and translates it to a flipbook.](http://www.turnjs.com/#)

### Steps:
1. Test this by exporting xml and/or html from InDesign
2. Test each program individually
3. Test them together

### Other Considerations: 
-  The original magazine needs to be more accessibly-designed to make it function properly
-  (Quarto)[https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-output.html] is an alternative maybe?
-  [Turn.js for HTML4 may work with InDesign where HTML5 won't](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/http://www.turnjs.com/turnjs4-api-docs.pdf)
